# MAT-303
Applied Statistics

This course was my first in depth look into true data analysis, especially with using R. Through this readme I will try to make everything as simplistic as I can and try to go into some detail about the specifics of the work we were working on week to week in each module. Within the individual readmes of each module I will also post the rubric for what we were to be answering within our report that we typed up going over our results.

Through this course I really found the drive and the assurance that I made the right decision in pursuing a degree for data analysis. Being able to go through these specific real world examples lead to a lot of the models coming to the same conclusions that I myself would believe, minus one exception within the second project in module seven. If this class is a sign of things to come with a career in data, I am extremely excited to see where I end up and what benefit I can hopefully be to the world.

[Module One](https://github.com/Jfarquhar33/MAT-303/tree/Module-One)

Module One we were utilizing first order regression models, one created for us and another that we created. Through this model we created a histogram, a scatterplot, created a correlation matrix, found the fitted values and residuals, plotted the residuals against the fitted values, created a Q-Q Plot, and made predictions with the model. The data set that we were exploring was one containing various variables relating to fuel economy in vehicles and we were assuming the role of an analyst working for a car maker.

[Module Two](https://github.com/Jfarquhar33/MAT-303/tree/Module-Two)

Module two we were utilizing mutlple regression models with interaction terms and qualitive indictors. The data set that we were exploring was the one again containing various variables relating to fuel economy in vehicles and we were again assuming the role of an analyst working for a car maker.

[Module Three](https://github.com/Jfarquhar33/MAT-303/tree/Module-three)

Module Three we began utilizing second order regression models. The data set that we were exploring was one containing various economic factors that could play a part in wage growth rate and we assumed the role of an analyst working for the government.

[Module Four](https://github.com/Jfarquhar33/MAT-303/tree/Module-Four)

Module Four lead to our first project of the course that would work upon all of the previous modules learnings with some expansion. As such, we were working with multiple regression models, qualitative variables interactions, and quadratic regression. The data set that we were exploring was one containing various variables of home features to determine what effect these variables had on the overall sale price. For this project we assumed the role of a data analyst working for a real estate company.

[Module Five](https://github.com/Jfarquhar33/MAT-303/tree/Module-Five)

Module Five had us working with logistic regression models. Through this we would also utilize the Wald Confidence Intervals, the Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness of Fit Test, create a Confusion Matrix, creating a Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve, and make predictions with our model. The data set that we were exploring was one containing basic information collected by a credit card company with variables that could effect an individuals likelyhood of defaulting on their credit and we assumed a role as a risk analyst working for said credit card company.

[Module Six](https://github.com/Jfarquhar33/MAT-303/tree/Module-Six)

Module Six began our work with decision trees. Through this we would split the data into training and testing sets, construct the classification decision tree, prune the tree based off of a cost complexity parameter, plotting the decision tree, creating a confusion matrix, and making predictions with our tree. The data set that we were exploring was again the one containing variables that may have an effect on an individuals likelyhood of defaulting on their credit and we once again assumed the role of a risk analyst working for a credit card company.

[Module Seven](https://github.com/Jfarquhar33/MAT-303/tree/Module-Seven)

Module Seven lead to our second and final project of the course that would work on the knowledge from the previous modules after our first project. This included two logistic regression model that we went through the Vald Confidence Intervals, the Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness of Fit Test, create a Confusion Matrix, creating a Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve, and make predictions with our model. We then moved onto a Random Forest Classification Model where we went through splitting the data into training and testing sets, construct the classification decision tree, prune the tree based off of a cost complexity parameter, plotting the decision tree, creating a confusion matrix, and making predictions with our tree. We finally moved into a Random Forest Regression Model where we utilized the same steps as the Random Forest Classification Model. Through this project we explored a data set containing various health indicators to see their effect on an individuals likelihood of having heart disease and we assumed a role as a data analyst at a university hospital.
