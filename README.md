# MAT-303
## Applied Statistics
## Project Two

R Script: To complete the tasks listed below, open the Project Two Jupyter Notebook link in the Assignment Information module. Your project contains the data set and a Jupyter Notebook. The Jupyter Notebook contains instructions and blank code blocks where you will write your R scripts. You will be asked to complete the following regression analyses:

Logistic Regression Models

Random Forest Models

Summary Report: Once you have completed all the steps in your R script, you will create a summary report to present your findings. Use the provided template to create your report. You must complete each of the following sections:

Introduction: Communicate all ideas by setting the context for your scenario and the analyses you will be performing.

Data Preparation: Identify the important variables and describe the characteristics of the data set.

Logistic Regression Models:

Report the results of logistic models by listing and interpreting estimates of model parameters.

Evaluate the significance of logistic models.

Use model equations to make predictions for logistic regression models.

Random Forest Models:

Report the results of random forest models by applying training and testing sets and interpreting plots.

Evaluate the utility of random forest models using a confusion matrix and root mean squared error.

Conclusion: Communicate all ideas by summarizing your findings and explain their practical implications.
