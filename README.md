## Applied Statistics
## Project One

R Script: To complete the tasks listed below, open the Project One Jupyter Notebook link in the Assignment Information module. Your project contains the data set and a Jupyter Notebook. The Jupyter Notebook contains instructions and blank code blocks where you will write your R scripts. You will be asked to complete the following regression analyses:

First Order Regression Model with Quantitative and Qualitative Variables

Complete Second Order Multiple Regression Model with Quantitative Variables

Nested Models F-Test

Summary Report: Once you have completed all the steps in your R script, you will create a summary report to present your findings. Use the provided template to create your report. You must complete each of the following sections by answering all of the questions in each section.

Introduction: Set the context for your scenario and the analyses you will be performing.

First Order Regression Model with Quantitative and Qualitative Variables:

Correlation analysis between the variables using data visualizations, correlation coefficients, and the correlation matrix

Reporting results of the model by listing and interpreting various model statistics, including R2 and Ra2

Evaluate the significance of the model by reporting parameter estimates and performing hypothesis testing for each estimate and the overall model.

Use model equations to make predictions.

Complete Second Order Model with Quantitative Variables:

Correlation analysis between the variables using data visualizations, correlation coefficients, and the correlation matrix

Reporting results of the model by listing and interpreting estimates of various model statistics, including R2 and Ra2

Evaluate the significance of the model by reporting parameter estimates and performing hypothesis testing for each estimate and the overall model.

Use model equations to make predictions.

Nested Models F-Test:

Reporting results of the model by listing and interpreting estimates of various model statistics

Evaluate the significance of the model by reporting parameter estimates and performing hypothesis testing for each estimate and the overall model.

Model Comparison: Evaluate whether the complete model is necessary by performing the nested models F-test.

Conclusion: Summarize your findings and explain their practical implications.
