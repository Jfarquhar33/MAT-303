# MAT-303
Applied Statistics

This course was my first in depth look into true data analysis, especially with using R. Through this readme I will try to make everything as simplistic as I can and try to go into some detail about the specifics of the work we were working on week to week in each module. Within the individual readmes of each module I will also post the rubric for what we were to be answering within our report that we typed up going over our results.

[Module One](https://github.com/Jfarquhar33/MAT-303/tree/Module-One)

Module One we were utilizing first order regression models, one created for us and another that we created. The data set that we were exploring was one containing various variables relating to fuel economy in vehicles and we were assuming the role of an analyst working for a car maker.

[Module Two](https://github.com/Jfarquhar33/MAT-303/tree/Module-Two)

Module two we were utilizing mutlple regression models with interaction terms and qualitive indictors. The data set that we were exploring was the one again containing various variables relating to fuel economy in vehicles and we were again assuming the role of an analyst working for a car maker.

[Module Three](https://github.com/Jfarquhar33/MAT-303/tree/Module-three)

Module Three we began utilizing second order regression models. The data set that we were exploring was one containing various economic factors that could play a part in wage growth rate and we assumed the role of an analyst working for the government.

[Module Four](https://github.com/Jfarquhar33/MAT-303/tree/Module-Four)

Module Four lead to our first project of the course that would work upon all of the previous modules learnings with some expansion. As such, we were working with multiple regression models, qualitative variables interactions, and quadratic regression. The data set that we were exploring was one containing various variables of home features to determine what effect these variables had on the overall sale price. For this project we assumed the role of a data analyst working for a real estate company.

[Module Five](https://github.com/Jfarquhar33/MAT-303/tree/Module-Five)

Module Five had us working with logistic regression models. Through this we would also utilize the Wald Confidence Intervals, the Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness of Fit Test, create a Confusion Matrix, creating a Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve, and make predictions with our model. The data set that we were exploring was one containing basic information collected by a credit card company with variables that could effect an individuals likelyhood of defaulting on their credit and we assumed a role as a risk analyst working for said credit card company.
